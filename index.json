[{"categories":null,"contents":"Urinary tract infections can be a common problem among women, especially after a vaginal delivery. Recurring infections can be troublesome. Not only because of the pain and urinary urgency, but also because of how often you might take antibiotics. Antibiotic use and overuse is associated with a host of health problems, especially digestive issues. I’m not going to specifically advise anyone to not use antibiotics if their doctor has prescribed them. But I will say that curing a UTI naturally has been done. If you choose to go this route, please proceed with caution, and keep your doctor in the loop. Untreated Urinary tract infections can lead to kidney infections, which can be fatal.\nThe How I believe there isn’t just one way to get rid of a UTI naturally. However you do it, YOU MUST DRINK A LOT OF WATER!!! This is rule #1. I would aim for around a gallon of water per day. Do this for a minimum of 5 days, but 7 would be ideal. The bacteria needs to be constantly flushed out so it has less time to multiply. Yes, forcing yourself to pee a bunch can be uncomfortable in the first day or two. But there really is no way around it if you’re looking to avoid antibiotics.\nHere I will list a remedy that I have used with success. If you have an herb that you like, or want to add cranberry juice, then by all means do so. I start this remedy as soon as I feel symptoms. Having had many UTIs, I know exactly the feeling. I don’t need to go to the doctor for a urine test. But if you are not sure, it’s still a good idea to start this remedy as soon as you think you might have a UTI. Then go get a urine test from your doctor. I tend to use this remedy for 5 solid days, taking it every two waking hours.\nThe What I have noticed that D-Mannose can cause some bloating. If you notice that, I would recommend skipping the D-Mannose until the next dose, or until the bloating has subsided. You can also just lower the amount of D-Mannose you take with each dose, but it’s a pretty important part of this regiment, so you don’t want to skip it for too long.\nSo again, I take this every 2 waking hours for 5 whole days. And of course I make sure to drink a ton of water on top of this.\nIngredients Mix in about 10 oz water:\n ½ a scoop (or about 2500mg) D-Mannose powder. 5 drops Grapefruit Seed Extract 1000mg ascorbic acid (or just take a vitamin C capsule) 2 droppers of Bladder Buddy herbal tincture, or something similar  I also take a probiotic pill specifically designed for female flora, like Vitanica Femecology Probiotic about 3-4 times per day with food.\nIf you experience a lot of pain with your UTI, I would recommend taking something like AZO Cystex, because they’re made specifically for urinary tract pain. But beware, it will make your pee bright orange! I would not advise taking this for more than the first day though, because (at least for me), the discomfort is a good indicator of whether or not this remedy is working. If you mask the symptom with pain killers, you may not notice if it’s not working for you.\n","date":"20","image":"images/flowers.jpeg","month":"Aug","permalink":"https://portlandpostpartum.github.io/post/uti/","tags":null,"title":"Urinary Tract Infections – Natural Care"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I am an acupuncture student at Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, as well as a lactation student with the OHSU/ PSU School of Health. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Social Science from Portland State University.\nI have worked in lactation for Northwest Mothers Milk Bank for 5+ years, starting as a volunteer. I haven’t worked there much since starting school, but I hope to coordinate with them after graduating to bring acupuncture to the table of normal lactation care. My senior capstone at Portland State was in current issues in pregnancy and birth, which is where I learned about milk banking, and began my interest in lactation and postpartum care.\nI grew up in Portland, and have lived here most of my life, except for a couple of short stints in Hawaii and one in San Francisco. I discovered the transformative powers of acupuncture after I was hit by a car while riding my bike in 2011. The acupuncture treatments were the only thing that really helped me during that time, and that changed the course of my life more than I could have expected. Despite having a big interest in medicine from a young age, I didn’t realize that I wanted to be an acupuncturist until years later on a trip to China where I spent a day in a Chinese medicine school. I didn’t want to leave the school that day, and when I arrived home, I began searching for schools to study Chinese medicine. I feel so fortunate that such an amazing school of Chinese medicine just happened to be in my home town.\nPrior to graduate school, I loved to travel. I’ve been to Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, China, South Africa, and Mozambique. These days my hobbies are more simple. When I’m not studying, I like to hike, camp, eat great food, and spend time with my family.\n","date":"01","image":"images/author.jpg","month":"Jan","permalink":"https://portlandpostpartum.github.io/author/danica/","tags":null,"title":"Danica"}]
