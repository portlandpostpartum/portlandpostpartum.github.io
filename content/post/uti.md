description: "Treatment of UTI without antibiotics"
---

Urinary tract infections can be a common problem among women, especially after a
vaginal delivery. Recurring infections can be troublesome not only because of
the pain and urinary urgency, but also because of how often you might take
antibiotics. Antibiotic use and overuse is associated with a host of health
problems, especially digestive issues. While I’m not going to specifically
advise anyone to not use antibiotics if their doctor has prescribed them, I will
say that curing a UTI naturally has been done. If you choose to go this route,
please proceed with caution, and keep your doctor in the loop. Untreated UTIs
can lead to kidney infections, which can be fatal.

I believe there isn’t just one way to get rid of a UTI naturally, but however
you do it, YOU MUST DRINK A LOT OF WATER!!! This is rule #1. I would aim for
around a gallon of water per day for a minimum of 5 days, but 7 would be ideal.
The bacteria needs to be constantly flushed out so it has less time to multiply.
Forcing yourself to pee a bunch can be uncomfortable in the first day or two,
but there really is no way around it if you’re looking to avoid antibiotics.

Here I will list a remedy that I have used with success. If you have an herb
that you like, or want to add cranberry juice, then by all means do so. I start
this remedy as soon as I feel symptoms. Having had many UTIs, I know exactly the
feeling, and don’t need to go to the doctor for a urine test. But if you are not
sure, it’s still a good idea to start this remedy as soon as you think you might
have a UTI, and then go get a urine test from your doctor. I tend to use this
remedy for 5 solid days, taking it every two waking hours. I have noticed that
D-Mannose can cause some bloating, so if you notice that, I would recommend
skipping the D-Mannose until the next dose, or until the bloating has subsided.
You can also just lower the amount of D-Mannose you take with each dose, but
it’s a pretty important part of this regiment, so you don’t want to skip it for
too long.

So again, I take this every 2 waking hours for 5 whole days, also making sure to
drink a ton of water on top of this.

Mix in about 10 oz water:

- ½ a scoop (or about 2500mg) D-Mannose powder.
- 5 drops Grapefruit Seed Extract
- 1000mg ascorbic acid (or just take a vitamin C capsule)
- 2 droppers of Bladder Buddy herbal tincture, or something similar

I also take a probiotic pill specifically designed for female flora, like
Vitanica Femecology Probiotic about 3-4 times per day with food.

If you experience a lot of pain with your UTI, I would recommend taking
something like AZO Cystex, because they’re made specifically for urinary tract
pain. But beware, it will make your pee bright orange! I would not advise taking
this for more than the first day though, because (at least for me), the
discomfort is a good indicator of whether or not this remedy is working. If you
mask the symptom with pain killers, you may not notice if it’s not working for
you.
