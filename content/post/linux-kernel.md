## Exploitation

SMEP disable via ROP, KASLR bypasss via DMESG

## Hacking With VIM

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33676829/vim-configuration-for-linux-kernel-development

## Build In Tree Modules

```console
make -j $(($(nproc)*4)) M=arch/x86/kvm/ modules
```

## Install Kernel To chroot

Here's how you install a kernel to a chroot. Or tar it up and
send it over to another system for use there.

```bash
# Edit your config
make olddefconfig
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/path/to/your/chroot
export INSTALL_PATH=${INSTALL_MOD_PATH}/boot
mkdir -p "${INSTALL_PATH}"
# Use number of cores times 4, this usually is about how many
# threads your system can run
make -j $(($(nproc)*4))
make install
make modules_install -j $(($(nproc)*4))
```

## Chroot

Instead of doing a regular chroot use `systemd-nspawn` which gives you a more fully featured chroot.

## Debugging With GDB

If you are lucky enough to be working on something thats in a VM you can get
GDB working!

You need to run the kernel without KASLR (on the cmdline thats `nokaslr`).

> If you don't disable KASLR gdb can't set breakpoints or display the source to you

Then you run QEMU with `-s -S`.

- `-s` says enable GDB on port `1234`
- `-S` says wait to start the VM until GDB connects.

Run GDB with `gdb ./vmlinux`

Now run

```console
(gdb) target remote 127.0.0.1:1234
```

To view the source code, type `layout src`

To focus back on the typey type window, type `focus cmd`

### Nested and VMCS

https://web.archive.org/web/20191105205408/http://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Improving-KVM-x86-Nested-Virtualization-Liran-Alon-Oracle.pdf

## Contributions

In your patches, write all about what you're doing. The kernel doesn't
seem to like comments very much. Instead they rely on people writing
insanely detailed commit messages describing what they are changing.

Every time you change the kernel you're changing something that has been
working fine for someone for X amount of long time. As such, you need to
be convincing for why your change should be accepted! Make your coverletter
and commit messages very detailed. The kernel is a big place. It may have
been a long time since someone reading your patch series has looked at the
place you're working. Be courtious and remind them of all the moving peices
involved in what you're doing, and why and how you're changing them.

### Etiquette

- You can say `patch` or `patchset` in your coverletter. Just not in the
  commit messages themselves.

## KVM

### VMX

When a VM enters VMX root mode (aka "I'm gonna run some VMs mode") using
the `VMXON` instruction, it sets up what's called a `VMCS` for each VM
/ virtualized processor it wants to run. All VMX related instructions
operate on whatever VMCS we pointed to via the `VMPTRLD` instruction.

### Nested

- L0 == The host

- L1 == The guest

- L2 == The guest of the guest

`vmx/nested.c` is responsible for emulating VMX for L1. When L1 does a
`VMLAUNCH` or `VMRESUME`, `enter_guest_mode` is called, which means that
`is_guest_mode` will now return `true`.

## Assembly

What is `jmp 1f`?
