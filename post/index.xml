Recurring infections can be troublesome. Not only because of the pain and urinary urgency, but also because of how often you might take antibiotics. Antibiotic use and overuse is associated with a host of health problems, especially digestive issues. I’m not going to specifically advise anyone to not use antibiotics if their doctor has prescribed them.</description></item></channel></rss>
