Recurring infections can be troublesome not only because of the pain and urinary urgency, but also because of how often you might take antibiotics. Antibiotic use and overuse is associated with a host of health problems, especially digestive issues. While I’m not going to specifically advise anyone to not use antibiotics if their doctor has prescribed them, I will say that curing a UTI naturally has been done.</description></item><item><title>Danica</title><link>https://portlandpostpartum.github.io/author/danica/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://portlandpostpartum.github.io/author/danica/</guid><description>I am an acupuncture student at Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, as well as a lactation student with the OHSU/ PSU School of Health. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Social Science from Portland State University.
I have worked in lactation for Northwest Mothers Milk Bank for 5+ years, starting as a volunteer. I haven’t worked there much since starting school, but I hope to coordinate with them after graduating to bring acupuncture to the table of normal lactation care.</description></item></channel></rss>
