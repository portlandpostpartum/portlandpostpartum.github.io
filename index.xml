      <description>I am an acupuncture student at Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, as well as a lactation student with the OHSU/ PSU School of Health. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Social Science from Portland State University.
I have worked in lactation for Northwest Mothers Milk Bank for 5+ years, starting as a volunteer. I haven’t worked there much since starting school, but I hope to coordinate with them after graduating to bring acupuncture to the table of normal lactation care.</description>
